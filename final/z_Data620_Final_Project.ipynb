    "### Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background of Corpora:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, one uses large bodies of linguistic data or Corpora. There are many well-known corpora. To name a few that are mentioned in the NLP textbook, Gutenberg Corpus, Web and Chat Text, Reuters Corpus, Inaugural Address Corpus etc. An elaborate list of Corpora samples, distributed with NLTK, is available on pages 46-47 of NLP textbook. A well-known corpus mentioned in the list is Senseval-2.\n",
    "The purpose of Senseval is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of computer programs, for automatically determining the sense of a word in a context, often referred as Word Sense Disambiguation or WSD, with respect to different words, different varieties of language, and different languages.\n",
    "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of deciding which sense a word has in any given context. It’s important because it has been very difficult to formalize the process of disambiguation, which humans can do effortlessly. For almost all applications of language technology, word sense ambiguity is a potential source of error. For example, if the English word 'drug' translates to French as either 'drogue' or 'médicament', then an English-French MT system needs to disambiguate every use of 'drug' in order to make the correct translations. Similarly, information retrieval systems may erroneously retrieve documents about an illegal narcotic when the item of interest is a medication; analogously, information extraction systems may make wrong assertions; and, text-to-speech will confuse violin bows for ship's bows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Senseval-2, an important Corpora:**\n",
    "Senseval-2 took place in the summer of 2001, and was followed by a workshop held in July 2001 in Toulouse, in conjunction with ACL 2001. It included tasks for Basque, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Swedish.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project goal:**\n",
    "The corpora contains data for four words: *hard*, *interest*, *line* and *serve*. In this project, I'll choose *interest* and load the corresponding data. Using the dataset, I'll build a classifier that predicts the correct sense tag for a given instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll choose two standard Classifiers Naive Bayes and Decision Tree and check the accuracies. "
